    <p>Makes 12 cupcakes. Light and fluffy vanilla cupcakes ready for any occasion!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>¾ cup superfine sugar</li>
                <li>⅔ cup butter, softened</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Prepare The Cupcakes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin tin or line cups with paper liners.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Beat in vanilla extract. Stir in flour just until mixed; spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 3/4 full.</li>
                <li>Don't ask if you can eat this.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 18 to 20 minutes. Cool in the tin briefly before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li>Slather in icing. Or decorate it.</li>
                <li>Now you can eat them. </li>
            </ol>
